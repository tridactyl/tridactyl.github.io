      <description>Here are a few of our favourite testimonials:
 Jeff King, co-author of git, June 2018
 I&amp;rsquo;m mostly just a user of tridactyl

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re friendly. You can talk to us via Matrix.org, #tridactyl on freenode and gitter.
If none of that suits you, filing an issue is a good way of getting our attention.
A couple of the developers can also be contacted via Keybase: bovine3dom and cmcaine, which is the preferred contact method for security issues.</description>
