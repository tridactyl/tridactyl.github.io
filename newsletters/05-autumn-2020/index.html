            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Welcome to the fifth quarterly Tridactyl newsletter.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had another productive quarter. It hasn&rsquo;t been quite as transformative as the last quarter - the addition of browser-wide <code>&lt;C-,&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;C-6&gt;</code> was hard to beat (I&rsquo;ve personally switched to using <code>&lt;C-,&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> and generally Tridactyl and I get along a lot better :)) - but we have added quite a few nice little things.</p>

<h2 id="highlighted-new-features" class="anchor-link"><a href="#highlighted-new-features">Highlighted new features<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>

<h3 id="for-everyone" class="anchor-link"><a href="#for-everyone">For everyone<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>A few new features relating to completions have been added: <code>&lt;C-o&gt;yy</code> copies the currently selected completion to the clipboard, <code>&lt;S-Delete&gt;</code> executes <code>:tabclose</code> on a selected completion&rsquo;s arguments and <code>&lt;C-Enter&gt;</code> executes the highlighted completion keeping the command line open - particularly useful for, e.g. <code>tabopen -b</code>. The commands relating to those binds are <code>ex.execute_ex_on_completion{,_args} [ex command]</code>; the &ldquo;args&rdquo; variant means that the ex-command that triggered the completion is omitted from the final executed command.</p>
<p>Next, a quality of life improvement for some of our users. The mode indicator can now be hidden in individual modes with <code>:set modeindicatormodes.[mode] true|false</code>. I hope this is useful for e.g. full screen applications and ignore mode; users often were frustrated by the appearance of the mode indicator on YouTube.</p>
<p>My favourite feature of the quarter, from a contributor, is <code>:jumble</code>, bound to <code>g!</code> by default, which shuffles the characters in all text on the page while persrvineg the frist and last letetr of each word. Just for fun.</p>

<h3 id="for-power-users" class="anchor-link"><a href="#for-power-users">For power users<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>I added a callback hintmode with <code>:hint -F elem =&gt; [... do some stuff in JS ...]</code>. I don&rsquo;t know why we didn&rsquo;t add it earlier - it was easy to implement and allows you to do a lot of cool stuff. It just goes to show that Tridactyl still has some low-hanging fruit!</p>
<p>autocommands now support <code>WebRequest</code> events - see <code>:help autocmd</code> for more details. It&rsquo;s especially useful for redirecting sites, like old reddit to new reddit, but comes with lots of caveats - rather than an ex-command, it runs a JavaScript snippet which must return an object with a specific format. There&rsquo;s no substitute for reading the help page on this one, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p><code>:js</code> now accepts a flag, <code>-d</code>, to specify an EOF character which allows space-separated arguments to be given to it, stored in the array <code>JS_ARGS</code>, meaning that people really can write their own ex-commands - the only thing left, really, is custom completions : ).</p>
<p><code>:autocmd</code> now provides magic variables for lots of events - see <code>:help autocmd</code> to see them all. It&rsquo;s useful for ensuring that an ex-command affects the right tab even if that tab is opened in the background.</p>

<h2 id="highlighted-bug-fixes" class="anchor-link"><a href="#highlighted-bug-fixes">Highlighted bug fixes<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Tridactyl <em>finally</em> should display the right version number on the new tab page and everywhere else, which means pretty version numbers for stable users. Beta users keep the current ugly version numbers : ).</p>
<p>In a fairly big change - you probably noticed it because your config disappeared despite my best efforts - we have ditched automatic synchronisation with the Firefox Sync storage. It had always caused problems for a minority of our users, but the introduction of a strict storage quota by Mozilla meant it broke for almost everyone using a custom theme. We now just use the local storage; if you want to keep your settings in sync with another machine, just run <code>:firefoxsync{pull,push}</code> periodically. Currently, the settings do not merge and will just overwrite when you push/pull - if anyone really wants that feature they should ask me. I suspect most people will manage fine without it. I&rsquo;m hoping that this change might have made our RC files more reliable, but so far I haven&rsquo;t heard any noises either way.</p>
<p>We also fixed a bug that was particularly frustrating to new users: the little pop-up telling you the address of a link you are hovering over is now hidden when the command line is opened. We do this by putting focus on a fake empty link and then quickly deleting it - a trick we found in <a href="https://github.com/amedama41/vvimpulation">VVimpulation</a>, a smaller vim-like browser project that actually has quite a few neat little features. Open source is nice sometimes.</p>
<p>As a workaround to make <code>&lt;C-,&gt;</code> compatible with Tree Style Tab, <code>:set escapehatchsidebarhack</code> stops us from closing the sidebar. Unfortunately, that means that we can&rsquo;t get focus back from the address bar, so pick your poison.</p>
<p>Finally, a bug that I personally found very distracting has been squashed: <code>yy</code> should no longer give spurious errors.</p>

<h2 id="other-stuff--the-near-future" class="anchor-link"><a href="#other-stuff--the-near-future">Other stuff + the near future<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>You might be interested to learn that <a href="https://console.substack.com/p/console-21">I did an interview for a little tech newsletter</a>, which was fun. Everyone loves talking about themselves.</p>
<p>In the next quarter, GitHub will stop doubling donations via GitHub sponsors. They still won&rsquo;t charge any fees, so it&rsquo;s still a vastly better deal than PayPal or Patreon (if your donation is small, those platforms will eat about ~30% of it by the time it gets to our pockets). This leaves us with a slight conundrum as my state-of-the-art forecasts predict that I would still like to eat broadly the same amount of food even after GitHub stops doubling the donations. I think we have enough users (and certainly the potential to have enough users) that, together, they could afford to keep me fed and maybe even housed [1]. I have a few ideas for persuading them to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>porting to Chrome and charging a fairly high yearly licence fee for it + big updates to it (~tens of pounds); security updates and major bug/compatibility fixes we&rsquo;d probably offer for free for as long as we could reasonably manage. Firefox would remain free and all our code would continue to be FOSS - people could just build Tridactyl for Chrome themselves if they wanted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>offering a paid-for weekly newsletter with Tridactyl tips and tricks (~a few pounds a month). Not sure how I&rsquo;d manage the mechanics of it - would people who got this newsletter currently be fed up if one suddenly turned up once a month?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asking slightly more prominently in Tridactyl and explaining why we need donations in a little more detail. I&rsquo;d probably add a setting to disable this &hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to turn into Wikipedia (but Wikipedia is rolling in cash, so maybe I do?). We&rsquo;d need the setting for the Chrome port, anyway, so that we weren&rsquo;t nagging people who had already paid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of features that are coming your way - I think I have finally been frustrated enough by our completion code that I am going to rewrite it to rely more heavily on configuration at runtime; I hope that will allow for more natural code re-use than the &ldquo;you only have one parent&rdquo; inheritance we currently use. It would also naturally allow users to write their own completions. I am optimistic that I will be able to merge the key-up binding PR in the next few months too - there&rsquo;s just one minor bug (that I know of) left to squash. The key-up bindings would allow for layers (e.g. hold \ to make j and k scroll farther) and &ldquo;videogame style&rdquo; smooth scrolling where the scrolling happens only while the key is held.</p>
<p>Thanks as ever for your support,</p>
<p>bovine3dom and the rest of the Tridactyl developers</p>
<p>[1]: NB - I am not in danger of starving or becoming homeless any time soon. However, there is a real risk that I would seek gainful employment if I was having to draw from my savings every month, which would mean less time spent on Tridactyl.</p>
