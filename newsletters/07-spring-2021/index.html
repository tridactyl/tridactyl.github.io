            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Welcome to the seventh quarterly Tridactyl newsletter. Somehow I missed the quarter and it&rsquo;s now summer &hellip; sorry! We added a few neat features this quarter - I find myself using <code>:tabaudio</code> a lot - but most of the work went on changes to our build system which have made working on Tridactyl vastly more pleasurable.</p>

<h2 id="highlighted-new-features" class="anchor-link"><a href="#highlighted-new-features">Highlighted new features<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>We have a couple of new features for tab/window management. The first relates to tabs playing audio: <code>:tabaudio</code>, bound to <code>ga</code> by default takes you to the tab currently playing audio in your current window; and a little speaker is shown next to tabs playing audio on <code>:tab</code> completions. The second is that you can now open windows in specific containers by using <code>:winopen -c [container]</code>.</p>
<p>Also on completions, you can now <code>:set completionfuzziness [0-1]</code> to control how fuzzy completion searching is for lots of completions. If you find that you get surprising results when you&rsquo;re filtering completions, consider turning this setting down to get more exact matches.</p>
<p>Our hint mode argument parser was totally rewritten, meaning that essentially all flags which could meaningfully be combined now can be combined. At the same time, <code>:hint -V</code> was added for hinting the entire page rather than just the visible area.</p>
<p>I gave themes a bit of TLC in Tridactyl; you can now load themes directly from a URL with <code>:colours --url</code>; <code>:colours</code> now has completions; <code>:colours</code> will fallback to loading from Tridactyl storage if a theme isn&rsquo;t found on disk; and finally it is much easier to get starting writing themes as you no longer require any magic classnames. These improvements were inspired by the &ldquo;Tips and Tricks&rdquo; newsletter I was writing at the time (the one available for 10 USD sponsors/patrons and up) &hellip; so I was right that they&rsquo;d have trickle-down effects!</p>
<p>I finally fixed something a bit daft: you&rsquo;ve been able to <code>:source --url</code> for a while to load an RC file from a web page without using the native messenger, but there was no way to write an RC file without the native messenger. Now you can, with <code>:mkt --clipboard</code> which will store your current settings as in an RC format in your system clipboard for you to paste wherever is convenient.</p>
<p>And finally, just for fun, a pull request added <code>:drawing{start,stop}</code>. These commands allow you to temporarily scribble on web pages with your mouse or stylus if you have one.</p>

<h2 id="neat-bug-fixes" class="anchor-link"><a href="#neat-bug-fixes">Neat bug fixes<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added a workaround for a Firefox bug that always confused new users: <code>:viewconfig</code> used to just give you a huge JSON dump on a single line when you called it from Tridactyl pages such as the new tab page or the help page, but it would appear in a snazzy JSON-viewer on other pages. It now works from Tridactyl tabs &hellip; most of the time. There&rsquo;s a bug where sometimes it now just doesn&rsquo;t work at all, on any tab, if your system is overloaded. If that happens to you, close some tabs until we get around to fixing it.</p>
<p>We rewrote completions a little so that we update the DOM a bit less, which could improve performance, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell. I personally feel like <code>&lt;S-Del&gt;</code> on completions has sped up a bit but I&rsquo;ve been wrong before.</p>

<h2 id="stuff-only-tridactyl-developers-care-about" class="anchor-link"><a href="#stuff-only-tridactyl-developers-care-about">Stuff only Tridactyl developers care about<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>This newsletter is a bit shorter than previous ones - we&rsquo;ve made fewer user-facing changes to Tridactyl this quarter. Instead, the bulk of my time on Tridactyl went on changing our build system from one centred on <code>webpack</code> to one centred on <code>esbuild</code>. Our development builds - how long it takes from making a change in Tridactyl to being able to test it - went from about 40 seconds to 1 second. It&rsquo;s made developing Tridactyl much less frustrating; it has made me very happy indeed. With luck this should mean that we can add features and fix bugs in Tridactyl more quickly.</p>
<p>At the same time, I rationalised the amount of stuff needed to reproduce a Tridactyl build - mostly because I felt sorry for Mozilla reviewers. Because our builds come with <code>:credits</code> containing an automatically generated list of contributors and <code>:version</code> which contains in some builds a git hash, you previously needed our entire git history to reproduce a build. Now we simply write those details to some small files when creating a build, so that a much smaller amount of code (5MB vs 100MB) is required. On a related note, <code>Tridactyl: Beta</code> builds got held up in the Mozilla review process for about 6 weeks, meaning no new releases were made in that time. It doesn&rsquo;t look like anyone other than me noticed. For now, our <code>Beta</code> releases will be semi-manual as Mozilla has started enforcing its &ldquo;you must manually upload source code alongside your automated submissions&rdquo; policy for non-listed extensions. This shouldn&rsquo;t make much difference to users but it has added a few minutes of drudgery to my week so I thought I would complain about it here&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-next-few-months" class="anchor-link"><a href="#plans-for-next-few-months">Plans for next few months<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>In the last newsletter I wrote that I thought I would probably spend a while fixing bugs in the native messenger, which came true (albeit with a lot of help from contributors). There are still a few - particularly, we broke <code>:set yankto selection</code>, which I keep meaning to look at.</p>
<p>Financially, donations are down a little this quarter, something along the lines of 20%, which I&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye on. I&rsquo;ve been very slow with the newsletters - I&rsquo;m not sure if that is a factor or if is just natural &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; as people rationalise their subscriptions. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll try to make sure the summer newsletter actually comes out in summer &hellip; and as a gentle reminder, I get about 30% more of your money if you donate via GitHub Sponsors rather than Patreon.</p>
<p>You may also be aware that Mozilla is taking some steps towards implementing &ldquo;Manifest V3&rdquo;, a Google initiative to &ldquo;make web extensions more secure&rdquo; (and accidentally nerf ad-blockers at the same time). Most of the noise online about that is about how Mozilla won&rsquo;t follow Google in making ad-blockers much worse, but they are intending to tighten up &ldquo;content security policy&rdquo; and use of <code>eval()</code> which <em>probably</em> means that <code>:js</code>, <code>:jsb</code> and <code>:hint -F</code> callbacks will stop working <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We could mitigate that by making <code>:composite</code> more powerful, but at some point if we make <code>:composite</code> too useful we will be violating the spirit of the rules. Switching to &ldquo;Manifest V3&rdquo; is planned to be compulsory some time in 2023, but as far as I understand it, Mozilla are talking about bringing some of these changes down to &ldquo;Manifest V2&rdquo; which we currently use, so we could see some features disappearing sooner. I&rsquo;ll keep you all up to date.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for your generous support,</p>

<p>a tiny angry footnote here: this is also going to stop in-browser language translation from working, which while already against Mozilla policies (no remote code execution) is currently possible. It infuriates me that Mozilla, while claiming to be a champion of minorities, doesn&rsquo;t see &ldquo;allowing minorities to read the internet in their own language&rdquo; as an absolute priority. Yes, Mozilla has their own offline language translation system in development but this is a bit like seeing a hungry person eating, slapping the food out of their hands because you think it is unhealthy and then planting a potato for them and expecting them to be grateful. <code>&gt;:(</code> <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
