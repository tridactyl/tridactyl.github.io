            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>It's been an eventful few months for Tridactyl. We were delisted from the AMO and have been slowly trying to get listed again. We're currently waiting to hear back from a reviewer on a query of ours before we submit what we will hope be our final revision which will be accepted. To have a hope of being relisted we have had to do some stuff we didn't want to do, namely editing <code>user.js</code> for some users without their consent - that issue details it all.</p>
<p>In light of this, the maintainer for our Arch Linux builds switched to a method which means that Mozilla does not have to sign Tridactyl - so they no longer get a say in what Arch Linux can or cannot provide for its users. If you're using Arch, I'd suggest you switch to these builds for peace of mind: <code>pacman -S firefox-tridactyl</code>.</p>
<p>There are some new features in Tridactyl 1.17.0 too: you can now use <code>source --url</code> to source an RC file from a URL without using the native messenger and <code>extoption</code> allows you to open the option pages of other extensions. We will probably release 1.18.0 soon which, hopefully, will make <code>source</code> a little more reliable which has been a perennial request from users with complex RC files.</p>
<p>A major reason that I'm writing this post is because bovine3dom has been accepted on to GitHub Sponsors. This initiative is a little like Patreon but Microsoft will match (i.e. double) any donations you make until October 2020 and charge no fees. You may wish to consider switching to this - simply follow this link: <a href="https://github.com/users/bovine3dom/sponsorship">https://github.com/users/bovine3dom/sponsorship</a></p>
<p>Thanks as ever for your support,</p>
<p>bovine3dom and the rest of the Tridactyl developers</p>
