            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Welcome to the sixth quarterly Tridactyl newsletter. As a gentle reminder, the second (and first paywalled) Tridactyl top-tips newsletter will be going out in the next few days. If you&rsquo;d like to receive it, simply up your monthly pledge to 10 USD or more on GitHub sponsors (preferred, as I get ~30%+ more of your money after taxes and transaction fees) or Patreon. I really appreciate every penny you send - it directly affects how long I can afford to work on Tridactyl. This next tips newsletter will be on making custom themes.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel like you can afford the extra newsletter, don&rsquo;t worry about it too much. I find that when I start documenting how crazy parts of Tridactyl it is often easier to re-write how it works in Tridactyl rather than suffer the embarrassment of communicating it; so writing the tips newsletters benefits everyone. I&rsquo;d also like to turn the newsletters into public wiki pages - I&rsquo;ll probably do that about 3 months after each one goes out.</p>

<h2 id="highlighted-new-features" class="anchor-link"><a href="#highlighted-new-features">Highlighted new features<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>

<h3 id="native-messenger-a-bit-quicker" class="anchor-link"><a href="#native-messenger-a-bit-quicker">Native messenger a bit quicker<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>The big change this quarter is that we&rsquo;ve rewritten the native messenger - the little programme that lets Tridactyl interact with your computer, for example to read your files from your filesystem or restart Firefox - in Nim, a small compiled language previously called Nimrod. Compared to the previous Python version, Nim starts up much faster leading to around speed-ups of 2-100x depending on the command and your system. Windows users who were using the cross-compiled Python executables should notice a particularly large speedup; it is very obvious when using the editor on <code>&lt;C-i&gt;</code> in a text-box if you haven&rsquo;t manually set <code>:editorcmd</code>. At the time of writing this newsletter, the native messenger wasn&rsquo;t quite ready for release on OSX (a lack of testing) or Windows (reimplementing <code>:restart</code> is non-trivial). On Linux the messenger should update automatically in the latest betas if you already have native installed - just run <code>:native</code> to check. <code>0.2.0</code> is the first Nim version of the messenger. Use <code>:nativeupdate</code> to update it if it hasn&rsquo;t updated itself.</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff" class="anchor-link"><a href="#other-stuff">Other stuff<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>Quite a few minor things have been added to Tridactyl, too. As always, I&rsquo;ll detail a few highlights here.</p>
<p><code>:tabclose</code> now accepts <code>window_number.tab_number</code> arguments, meaning that Shift-Delete works to close tabs even in other windows on <code>:taball</code> completions. The selected completion on <code>:taball</code> doesn&rsquo;t currently move to the next option as you would expect. I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll get round to implementing that soon.</p>
<p>Three new hint modes were added: <code>;x</code> and <code>;X</code> &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; hint modes added if you have the native messenger and <code>xdotool</code> installed: these actually move the mouse and click on the element you select, so no amount of JS-shenanigans will break it. <code>;K</code> reversible element-&ldquo;kill&rdquo; hint mode added with <code>:elementunhide</code> to resurrect elements. <code>;Y</code> image-to-clipboard hint mode added.</p>
<p>Just for fun, <code>g!</code> jumbles all the text on the page, leaving the start and end of each word in the same place. Give your brain some exercise.</p>
<p>As a small quality-of-life improvement, we&rsquo;ve changed how the clipboard commands (<code>yy</code>, etc) work under-the-bonnet to use a newer clipboard API. They&rsquo;re quite a bit quicker than they were and throw fewer errors now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added a few treats for advanced users, too: a <code>UriChange</code> event added for <code>:autocmd</code> for use as a last resort on modern single-page application (SPA) sites where <code>DocLoad</code> events don&rsquo;t fire. Unfortunately it uses a little bit of extra power, so don&rsquo;t turn it on unless you need it. Additionally, <code>:js</code> accepts a flag <code>-d</code> and an EOF character, which will then give you <code>JS_ARGS</code> array to use of space-separated arguments, making it easier to make more complex ex-commands.</p>

<h2 id="neat-bug-fixes" class="anchor-link"><a href="#neat-bug-fixes">Neat bug fixes<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>

<h3 id="fewer-race-conditions-on-user-input-in-the-command-line" class="anchor-link"><a href="#fewer-race-conditions-on-user-input-in-the-command-line">Fewer race conditions on user input in the command line<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>In the command line, we now wait for completions to load before processing any commands that interact with the completions. In practice this means that if you have a website that you regularly visit, you can build up muscle memory to quickly go to and select that site - say, for example, you visit <code>news.bbc.co.uk</code> a lot, you can access it by typing <code>tne&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a caveat here in that you have to wait for the command line to have loaded at least a bit before you continue to type, but once the input box has appeared you can type as quickly as you like.</p>
<p>With this fix, I&rsquo;m personally much happier using Tridactyl than I was. For me, it is a big step towards being a reliable tool I enjoy using and away from being a janky thing that I simply put up with.</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff-1" class="anchor-link"><a href="#other-stuff-1">Other stuff<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h3>
<p>Help and tutor pages now follow your theme. <code>:editor</code> is quicker on Windows (even without the new native messenger) as we no longer check for Linux terminals which are vanishingly unlikely to exist. And that&rsquo;s pretty much it &hellip; I think we must have added and then fixed lots of bugs in the beta which aren&rsquo;t really worth mentioning in these newsletters.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-next-few-months" class="anchor-link"><a href="#plans-for-next-few-months">Plans for next few months<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep making the tips &amp; tricks newsletters and maybe try to advertise them a little more. We currently have 12 donors across all platforms that will receive them. In monetary terms that is getting towards the &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; line, I think. We&rsquo;ll see whether it becomes too exhausting writing them each month, especially if I start tidying them up for the wiki too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still toying with the idea of looking seriously into a paid-for Chrome port, but I think I&rsquo;ve found more things that I want to fix in Tridactyl first. I&rsquo;m going to take another look at rewriting the completions code - updating the all-window-tab completions because they missed something that the one-window-tab completions had was unpleasant because there was so much duplicated code.</p>
<p>Finally, I expect I&rsquo;ll spend much of the next quarter fixing bugs I didn&rsquo;t spot in the new native messenger : )</p>
<p>As always, thanks for your generous support,</p>
<p>bovine3dom and the rest of the Tridactyl developers</p>
